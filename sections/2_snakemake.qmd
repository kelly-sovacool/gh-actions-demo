Dry-run & lint a Snakemake workflow

Take a look at the example Snakemake workflow: `snakemake-workflow/workflow/Snakefile`

[{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/kelly-sovacool/gh-actions-sandbox/tree/main/.github/workflows/build-python.yml)

```yaml
name: snakemake

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
  pull_request:

jobs:
  dryrun-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: # <1>
      image: snakemake/snakemake:v7.32.4 # <1>
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Dry-run # <2>
        run: | # <2>
          snakemake \ # <2>
            -s ./snakemake-workflow/workflow/Snakefile \ # <2>
            --dry-run # <2>
      - name: Lint # <3>
        run: | # <3>
          snakemake \ # <3>
            -s ./snakemake-workflow/workflow/Snakefile \ # <3>
            --lint # <3>
```
1. Specify a Docker container for all steps in this job to run inside.^[<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container>]
2. Dry-run the Snakemake workflow. If the dry run completes successfully, you at least know there aren't syntax errors in your Snakemake code.
3. Lint the workflow with Snakemake's built-in linter to ensure code quality.

Beware: github's default runners are limited to 4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM^[<https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories>].
