GitHub Actions is a powerful platform for CI/CD and automating just about any
task you want.
Once you understand the basics, the best way to get started is by re-using
workflows from others.
We have a repository of example workflows & actions that we re-use often for
[CCBR]((https://github.com/ccbr/) projects. 
Take a look at [CCBR Actions](https://github.com/ccbr/actions) for example
workflows that you can start using in your repositories right away.
